# Introduction

With the conclusion of the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics at the Beijing National Gymnasium on February 20, the ranking of the medal standings will not change if countries can ensure the fairness of the competition, and it will be recorded in history. Is the medal count in the Olympics simply a leaderboard? What about the Olympic medal tally in the academic world? A widely accepted assumption is that it can reflect a country's comprehensive strength in the economy, scientific research, culture, education, and other aspects and can be used as a reference for national power ranking.
